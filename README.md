# Explor

## Project Description

The aim for this project is to enable users to plan their whole trip.

The first
feature to be implemented is the leisure activity planner. It shows the thing to
do in your free time in (and around) a city.

## What is your motivation for creating this project?

I travel a lot for my work and I always wonder what I could do once the work is
finished. In the first stages of the project I will implement the ability to see
both cultural points of interest as well as social meeting points.

## How will users interact with your web site?

The user will enter the name of the city, the time they are available and how
far they are willing to travel.

Based on that criteria a list is created on what to do in the city. They can
select items from that list and plan their trip accordingly.

## What 3rd Party API(s) will you integrate with?

Most probably I will use the [Google Maps Places
API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro). If it turns out to
be difficult, I might change it to some other places API.

## Tech Stack

I will use the CSS framework [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) to create the layout of
the site.

It is currently not planned to use any third-party JS library.

## What will be your process?

### What project management tool will you use?

I will use GitHub Projects to track the process of the app.

The approach I am going to take is a lot like Scrum, without some of the
processes. The Sprint length will be about 1 week and I try to work on the
project for three days a week.

### How often will you commit your code?

On the three days of the week I work I will create as many (atomic) commits as I need.

### How will you test your web site?

Currently I will not use a testing framework, but just test the website myself
and invite friends to review the website to test for usability.

### How will you design the layout of your website? Will you use a wireframing tool? Will you draw it on paper?

The wireframing will happen on paper and be later uploaded to this repository.
